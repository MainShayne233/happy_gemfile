# HappyGemfile

House keep on your Gemfile no more! Happy Gemfile is here to clean up a small fraction of the clutter in your codebase by alphabetizing your gems!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'happy_gemfile'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install happy_gemfile

## Usage

You can call the executable in the directory with the gemfile to be spruced up!
```bash
$ happy_gemfile
```

Alternatively, you can call the alphabetize method directly in your app, say, in your config.rb.
```ruby
HappyGemfile.alphabetize
```
